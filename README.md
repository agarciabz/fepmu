# Fire Emblem: Pick My Units

Randomize your Fire Emblem run with this. It only supports Fire Emblem Three Houses at the moment.

Initially this was a fork of [henry-alakazhang's Pick Your Units](https://github.com/henry-alakazhang/pick-your-units) but later I decided to use this project as an excuse to learn React and apply some ~~over-engineering~~ good practises I acquired over the last years.

## Running locally
